    The <b>curricular internship</b> was a requirement of the Master of Science in Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University. I worked under the supervision of Professor Simone Cerreia-Vioglio. Tasks included performing a literature review on the topic of the application of the game-theoretic concept of Self-Confirming Equilibrium in Macroeconomics. I wrote a short paper summarizing my findings and proposing possible future avenues for research on the topic.

    My <b>first work experience</b> was a four-weeks-long <b>internship</b> in Sofia, Bulgaria, under the supervision of Georgi Momchilov. I was tasked to organize the results of the shift-shares decomposition of export growth that the research department had just performed. The work culminated in a short paper and a presentation that I had to give in front of the entire research department of the BNB.
