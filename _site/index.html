      <p>Welcome to my website. I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I will be graduating in July 2021. My dissertation focuses on currency mismatches, predicting financial crises using machine learning algorithms, and analyze the financial effects of dollar appreciation on economic growth. I also work on issues related to international economics, trade, and investment.</p>



<p>Before joining PhD program, I held a RA position in a government policy advisory body. It has given me a real understanding of the applications in policy formulation.</p> 

<p>With my research, I seek to find the solutions and make a contribution that are critical to the central banking policy research.</p>

</p><p>We develop a currency mismatch index and examine the causes of currency mismatches in emerging market economies. This study is based on a unique dataset on 22 economies from 2008 to 2017. We also construct the original sin index using granular data on international debt securities. We find Latin American countries, followed by Central European countries, suffer from the original sin and currency mismatch problems. The panel regression estimates show that country size, trade openness, and the level of economic and financial development explain cross-country variations in currency mismatches. Our empirical results suggest that unstable monetary and fiscal policies are the primary causes of currency mismatches. The results indicate that a better institutional environment reduces currency mismatches. These findings call for monetary independence, stable fiscal policy, and macroprudential policy measures to minimize currency mismatches.</p>

</p><p>We aim to investigate the macroeconomic effects of balance sheet vulnerabilities with exchange rate movements in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and developing economies (EDEs). We prepare a novel dataset on foreign currency exposure for the period of 1970-2018. We employ the dynamic panel regression, which addresses reverse causality, omitted variables, and simultaneity bias in the growth model. Our results show that currency exposure does cause lower growth outcomes. This relationship is proved to be robust to several specifications, different samples, and alternative measures of external exposure. In contrast with previous studies, our results suggest that original sin and currency mismatches indeed matter for AEs as well. We also provide evidence on exchange rate movements can negatively influence economic activity via a financial channel. Further, we elucidate the linkage between long-run effects of currency exposure on economic growth and find currency mismatches are detrimental to the long-run economic growth. This study provides policy recommendations for debt management and controlling currency mismatches. Evidently, we find that economies are better off with fixed exchange rates when they have greater balance sheet vulnerabilities. Thus, fixing currencies can positively affect economic growth by reducing currency risk and volatile capital flows. We highlight the need for improvement in institutions to lower countries' balance sheet vulnerabilities, such as better monetary and fiscal policy and effective use of macroprudential measures.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12 details"><h4>Role of Original Sin and Currency Mismatches on Currency, Banking and Debt Crisis</h4><p>April 2021 </p></div>

</p><p>The global financial crisis has sparked an interest in the association between financial crises and currency mismatches. This study investigates the role of external vulnerable indicators in crises prediction. We contribute to the literature by constructing a broader version of original sin that includes currency composition of international debt securities and cross-border banking loans for 165 countries from 1970 to 2018. We also measure the new currency mismatch index using broad original sin and find that re-emerge the problem of original sin and currency mismatches in emerging developing and economies (EDEs) during the post-global financial crisis. We identify the global and macroeconomic factors that could contain valuable information to uncover external vulnerabilities leading to financial crises. Our findings suggest that higher value of original sin and currency mismatches associated with a more likelihood of currency, debt, and banking crisis and support the third-generation crisis models. Further, to improve the resilience of EDEs, the policymakers need to implement effective monetary and fiscal policy frameworks. Finally, EDEs should raise forex reserves and limit foreign currency borrowings.</p>
